The bright\\nblue area indicates that the cancer spread to the occipital lobe (lower right).disease\\ndisease , any harmful deviation from the normal structural or functional\\nstate of an or ganism, generally associated with certain signs and\\nsymptoms and dif fering in nature from physical injury . A diseased\\norganism commonly exhibits signs or symptoms indicative of its\\nabnormal state. Thus, the normal condition of an or ganism must be\\nunderstood in order to recognize the hallmarks of disease.\\nNevertheless, a sharp demarcation between disease and health  is not\\nalways apparent.\\nThe study of disease is called pathology . It involves the determination of the cause (etiology) of the disease,\\nthe understanding of the mechanisms of its development (pathogenesis), the structural changes associated\\nwith the disease process (morphological changes), and the functional consequences of those changes.\\nCorrectly identifying the cause of a disease is necessary to identifying the proper course of treatment.\\nHumans, other animals , and plants  are all susceptible to diseases of some sort. However , that which disrupts\\nthe normal functioning of one type of or ganism may have no ef fect on the other types.\\nMajor  distinctions\\nThe normal state of an or ganism represents a condition of delicate physiological balance, or homeostasis , in\\nterms of chemical, physical, and functional processes, maintained by a complex of mechanisms that are not\\nfully understood. In a fundamental sense, therefore, disease represents the consequences of a breakdown of\\nthe homeostatic control mechanisms. In some instances the af fected mechanisms are clearly indicated, but in\\nmost cases a complex of mechanisms is disturbed, initially or sequentially , and precise definition of the\\npathogenesis of the ensuing disease is elusive. Death in humans and other mammals , for example, often\\nresults directly from heart  or lung failure, but the preceding sequence of events may be highly complex,\\ninvolving disturbances of other or gan systems and derangement of other control mechanisms.\\nThe initial cause of the diseased state may lie within the individual or ganism itself, and the disease is then said\\nto be idiopathic, innate, primary , or “essential.” It may result from a course of medical treatment, either as an\\nunavoidable side ef fect or because the treatment itself was ill-advised; in either case the disease is classed as\\niatrogenic. Finally , the disease may be caused by some agent external to the or ganism, such as a chemical that\\nis a toxic agent. In this case the disease is noncommunicable; that is, it af fects only the individual or ganism\\nexposed to it. The external agent may be itself a living or ganism capable of multiplying within the host and\\nsubsequently infecting other or ganisms; in this case the disease is said to be communicable.\\nNoncommunicable disease10/10/24, 8:46 PM disease -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia\\nhttps://www.britannica.com/print/article/165521 1/12'),\n",

They can arise from environmental exposures or from genetically determined\\nabnormalities, which may be evident at birth or which may become apparent later in life. The World Health\\nOrganization  (WHO) has identified four major types of noncommunicable disease: cancer , cardiovascular\\ndisease  (e.g., heart attack , stroke ), chronic respiratory disease  (e.g., asthma ), and diabetes mellitus . WHO\\nestimates that, combined, these four groups of conditions account for 82 percent of all deaths from\\nnoncommunicable disease.\\nNoncommunicable diseases that arise from inherited genetic abnormalities often leave an individual ill-\\nequipped to survive without some form of treatment. Examples of inherited disease include cystic fibrosis ,\\nDown syndrome , and inborn errors of metabolism , which are present at birth. Examples of inherited diseases\\nthat emer ge in adulthood include Huntington disease  and certain forms of cancer (e.g., familial breast cancer\\ninvolving inherited mutations  in either of the genes  BRCA1  or BRCA2 ).\\nMetabolic defects\\nMetabolic defects of fer useful insight into understanding the\\nimpact of noncommunicable disease on the function of the\\nhuman body . In humans, for example, the lack of an enzyme\\nknown as phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is necessary for the\\nmetabolism of the common amino acid  phenylalanine , leads to\\nthe disease phenylketonuria  (PKU), which appears at a few\\nweeks of age and, if not treated, is often associated with the\\nonset of intellectual disability . Other metabolic defects may\\nmake their appearance only relatively late in life. Examples of\\nthis situation are the diseases gout and type 2 (late-onset, or\\nadult-type) diabetes. Gout results from an accumulation within\\nthe tissues of uric acid , an end product of nucleic acid  metabolism. Late-onset diabetes results from an\\nimpaired release of insulin  by the pancreas  and a reduction in responsiveness of body tissues to insulin that\\nlead to the inability to metabolize sugars  and fats properly .\\nAlternatively , the metabolic fault may be associated with aging  and the concomitant deterioration of control\\nmechanisms, as in the loss of calcium  from bone  in the condition known as osteoporosis . That these late-\\ndeveloping metabolic diseases also have a genetic basis—that is, that there is an inherited tendency for the\\ndevelopment of the metabolic faults involved—seems to be definitely the case in some instances but remains\\neither incompletely understood or uncertain in others.\\nEnvir onmental hazards\\nMetabolic abnormalities also may result from the ef fects of external environmental factors, a relationship that\\nhas been suggested by the apparent confinement of certain diseases to sharply delimited geographic areas.\\nNotable examples are goitre  and mottled enamel of the teeth in humans.

Mottled enamel of teeth results from\\nconsumption of excessive amounts of fluoride, usually in water\\nsupplies. Conversely , dental caries  (tooth decay) is found to\\noccur to a greater extent in areas in which water supplies are\\ndeficient in fluoride.\\nAnalogous conditions in herbivorous domesticated animals result\\nfrom deficiencies in trace elements , such as zinc and selenium , in the soil of pastures and, therefore, also in\\nplants  making up the diet. Similarly , plant growth suf fers from soil deficiencies of essential elements,\\nparticularly nitrogen , potassium , and phosphorus . These conditions can be corrected by adding salts to the\\ndiets of domesticated animals and by applying fertilizers  to soil.\\nThere also are diseases resulting from toxic substances added to\\nthe environment in suf ficient amounts to produce symptoms of\\ngreater or lesser severity . Although human disorders of this\\nnature are best known, untoward ef fects of such contamination of\\nthe environment occur also in plants and animals. The problems\\ncaused by environmental toxic agents are lar gely, if not entirely ,\\nanthropogenic. Occupational diseases , for example, are\\nassociated with factors that are present in the work environment\\nor are otherwise encountered in the course of work. Examples of\\noccupational diseases include asbestosis , silicosis , and\\nbyssinosis , which af fect the respiratory tract and which are\\ncaused by inhalation of, respectively , asbestos , silica , and cotton\\ndust. Also important in this regard are metal poisoning, particularly involving mercury , lead, or arsenic ;\\npoisoning with solvents  used in industrial processes; and exposure to ionizing radiation . Of greater\\nimportance to the population at lar ge are the diseases that result from exposure to insecticides  and\\natmospheric pollutants. Such diseases usually , though not invariably , are of a chronic nature; they require\\nprolonged exposure to the noxious agent and develop slowly . Environmental diseases of all kinds, however ,\\nalso may predispose the individual to other diseases; for example, respiratory diseases such as silicosis render\\nthe suf ferer more susceptible to tuberculosis .\\nCommunicable disease\\nCommunicable, or contagious, diseases are those transmitted from one or ganism to another . Infectious\\ndiseases  are diseases caused in the host by infection with living, and therefore replicating, microor ganisms,\\nsuch as animal parasites, bacteria , fungi , or viruses .

Lower respiratory infections, diarrheal\\ndiseases, and tuberculosis  are among the most common and\\ndeadliest types of infectious diseases. Since the latter part of the\\n20th century , however , death rates from infectious disease have\\ndropped considerably , because of increases in vaccination and\\nother methods of disease prevention and because of\\nimprovements in treatment and in the control of disease spread.\\nNotable progress included the near elimination of polio  from the\\nworld by the early 2000s and substantial declines in AIDS -\\nrelated deaths by 2015. As a result, by the second decade of the\\n21st century , many infectious diseases, particularly those of childhood, were being replaced by\\nnoncommunicable diseases of adulthood.\\nHost-parasite r elationships\\nIn the context of communicable disease, the host-parasite\\nrelationship must be considered not only with respect to the\\nindividual host-parasite interaction but also in terms of the\\ninterrelationship between the host and parasite populations, as\\nwell as those of any other host species involved. Most\\npathogenic bacteria are obligate parasites; that is, they are found\\nonly in association with their hosts. Some, such as staphylococci\\nand streptococci , can proliferate outside the body of the host in\\nnutritive materials infected from host sources. Within the tissues\\nof the host, these or ganisms set up local infections that spread\\nthroughout the body . Still other bacteria, such as the glanders\\nbacillus ( Burkholderia mallei ) and the gonococci, meningococci ,\\nand pneumococci , are more closely adapted parasites, capable of\\nmultiplying outside the body of the host only under the artificial\\nconditions of the laboratory . All these microor ganisms have\\ncomplete cell structures and metabolic capabilities.\\nA greater degree of dependence on the host is shown by\\nrickettsiae  and viruses. Rickettsiae are microor ganisms that have\\nthe cell structure of bacteria. They exhibit a small degree of\\nmetabolic activity outside cells, but they cannot grow in the\\nabsence of host tissue. The ultimate in parasitism, however , is\\nthat of the viruses, which have no conventional cell structure and\\nconsist only of a nucleic acid  (either DNA  or RNA ) wrapped in a10/10/24, 8:46 PM disease -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia\\nhttps://www.britannica.com/print/article/165521 4/12'),\n",

Viruses are obligatory intracellular\\nparasites, capable of multiplying only within the cells of the host,\\nand they have no independent metabolic activity of their own.\\nThe genetic information that directs the synthesis of virus\\nmaterials and certain enzymes enters the host cell, parasitizes its\\nchemical processes, and directs them toward the synthesis of new virus elements.\\nThese various degrees of parasitism suggest that the host-parasite relationship is subject to continuing\\nevolutionary change. The adaptation of the microor ganism to its parasitic existence, in this view , is\\naccompanied by progressive loss in metabolic capability , with eventual complete physiological dependence of\\nthe parasite on the host.\\nParasite specificity\\nThe condition of obligate parasitism is associated with a degree of specificity of the parasite with regard to the\\nhost; i.e., the parasite generally is more closely adapted to one species of host than to all others.\\nMicroor ganisms adapted to plant hosts, with only rare exception, are unable to infect animal hosts, and\\nconversely microor ganism parasites of animals rarely occur in plants. A number of host species may be\\nsusceptible to infection with a given parasite, and the pattern of host susceptibility need not correspond with\\ntaxonomic relationships, including hosts varying as widely as vertebrates  and invertebrates .\\nThe ability to produce consistently fatal disease in a host is often of negative survival value to the parasite,\\nbecause it is quite likely to eliminate quickly all available hosts. Consistent with this, there is a tendency for\\ndisease resulting from infection to be less severe when adaptation of the parasite to the host has become close.\\nA change in severity of a disease, presumably resulting from adaptation , has been observed in the case of the\\nspirochete  that causes syphilis , with the disease in humans being less severe today than it was in the 16th\\ncentury . However , ecological studies of parasitism indicate that it is incorrect to assume that all host-parasite\\nrelationships will evolve toward reduced antagonism and that a resultant disease state eventually will be\\nameliorated. (For further information see community ecology .)\\nDisease produced in related host species may be either milder or more severe than in the definitive host. In\\ncertain cases, adaptation is so close that the parasite is unable to infect any other hosts under natural\\nconditions; this is true of many microor ganisms producing disease in humans. On the other hand, natural\\ninfection of secondary hosts may occur , leading to severe or fatal disease. Rabies , for example, is a fatal\\ndisease in almost all animal hosts. In some species, such as the bat, however , the virus may persist for long\\nperiods as an asymptomatic infection.\\nHost resistance\\nThe specificity of pathogenic microor ganisms with regard to their hosts is an expression not only of\\ndifferences in microbial character but also of dif fering host resistance. The ability of a microor ganism to\\nproduce disease can be evaluated only in terms of the host reaction, and, conversely , the resistance, or\\nimmunity , of the host can be judged only with regard to its ef fect on the microor ganism. In short, the two are\\nbut dif ferent facets of the same phenomenon, and either may be evaluated by holding the other constant and10/10/24, 8:46 PM disease -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia\\nhttps://www.britannica.com/print/article/165521 5/12'),\n",

Commonly , for example, virulence of an infective agent is determined experimentally by\\ninoculating groups of hosts with graded doses of the agent and determining, by interpolation, the dose that\\nproduces a typical reaction in 50 percent of the host individuals inoculated. This dose is called the median\\neffective dose, or ED 50. It is related in inverse fashion to virulence and in a direct way to resistance. In other\\nwords, in a given host, the higher the ED 50, the less virulent the infective or ganism; or , with a microor ganism\\nof known virulence, the higher the ED 50 with the host it is tested against, the greater the resistance of that\\nparticular host. Customarily , in dif ferent host species, resistance is expressed as an n-fold increase or decrease\\n(with n equal to a whole number) in the ED 50 over that of the normal host species.\\nThis kind of assay is possible because both virulence and resistance tend to occur in approximately normal, or\\nbell-shaped, frequency distributions; that is, most members of the host and microor ganism populations occupy\\na central position with regard to these properties, exceptional individuals appearing at both extremes. With\\nreference to host resistance, this explains the varied incidence of disease in a host population exposed to a\\nstatistically constant dose of the infectious agent. In most practical considerations the dose is only statistically\\nconstant, for it varies greatly from one host to another depending on circumstances relating to transfer of the\\ninfectious agent. Individual variation in host resistance to infection, however , is due to more than mere\\nnumbers of infectious agents encountered; it also results from innate factors in the individual host or ganism.\\nAt any rate, variation in host resistance means that not all individuals making up a population essentially\\nuniversally susceptible to infection with newly appearing infectious agents will contract the disease on first\\nexposure.\\nAppar ent and inappar ent infection\\nBecause infection is not an all-or -nothing af fair, individual variation in resistance to disease also results in\\ndifferent degrees of reaction to the infectious agent; i.e., the outcome of the interaction of host and parasite is\\nvariable in each individual instance. Some individual hosts show symptoms typical of the disease, and\\ninfection is readily recognized. Others, having greater resistance, exhibit symptoms of the disease in only a\\nmild or atypical form, and infection in these individuals may not be clearly recognizable. Still other host\\norganisms become infected with the invading parasite but show no symptoms of the disease. Distinction,\\ntherefore, must be made between infection and disease, the former occurring on occasion without any sign of\\nthe latter . There may be, of course, no such thing as totally asymptomatic infections. What are taken to be\\nsuch may be, in fact, only those infections with symptoms occurring beneath the level of observation.\\nNonetheless, such inapparent infections, or “carrier” states, clearly exist and serve to transmit the infection to\\nsusceptible hosts.\\nThe overt consequence of infection of a host population of\\nrelatively high resistance is the sporadic occurrence of cases of\\ndisease and a high carrier -case ratio. The infection, in other\\nwords, is widely prevalent in the host population in\\nasymptomatic form, and the relatively rare observed cases of\\ndisease represent the highly susceptible few in the host\\npopulation making up one extreme of the bell-shaped frequency10/10/24, 8:46 PM disease -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia\\nhttps://www.britannica.com/print/article/165521 6/12'),\n",

If host resistance is too high, or\\ntoo low , the disease will die out: in the former case, because the\\ninfective agent is unable to maintain itself and, in the latter ,\\nbecause it eliminates the host. One of the best-known\\nillustrations of the importance of relative host resistance to\\nsurvival of the parasite is that of the plague  bacillus ( Yersinia\\npestis ). Plague is primarily a disease of rodents  and persists as\\nfocuses of infection in these hosts. The black rat (Rattus rattus )\\nand the Norway rat ( R. norvegicus ) are commonly associated\\nwith plague but are too susceptible to allow its persistence; i.e., the host is destroyed. The infection persists,\\nhowever , in relatively resistant wild rodents.\\nInheritance of r esistance\\nThat there exists genetic control of resistance is suggested by the mere fact of host specificity , and such\\ncontrol has been demonstrated amply by experimental studies on both plant and animal hosts. The former , for\\nexample, had wide practical application in the development, by selective breeding, of strains and races of\\nplants of economic importance, especially grains, that are resistant to a wide variety of plant diseases .\\nIn general, resistance developed by selective breeding is only partially specific; that is, the observed resistance\\nto infection with pathogenic microor ganisms, and to the toxins of such or ganisms, is manifested toward\\ngroups of related microor ganisms producing similar diseases, not to single or ganisms alone. Although\\nresistance to disease has been found in a few instances to be a function of a single gene , in most cases several\\ngenes are involved.\\nFor many years there has been considerable interest in the possibility of dif ferences in resistance to disease\\nassociated with the dif ferent human populations. While marked dif ferences in morbidity and mortality occur\\nbetween whites and nonwhites in the United States, for example, it is often dif ficult to rule out dif ferences in\\nexposure to infection, socioeconomic factors, and dif ferential application of preventive and therapeutic\\nmeasures in accounting for them. Nevertheless, there are fragmentary indications that there may be suf ficient\\ngenetic segregation among races to result in dif ferences in resistance to certain diseases.\\nEpidemiology\\nThe interaction of host and parasite populations constitutes the subject matter of epidemiology  (the term being\\nmore inclusive than suggested by its relation to the word epidemic ). In most instances the epidemiology of\\ninfectious disease is characteristic of that disease and is an outgrowth of biological properties of the parasite\\nand the host, including host specificity and the behaviour of the host species as populations.10/10/24, 8:46 PM disease -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia\\nhttps://www.britannica.com/print/article/165521 7/12'),\n",

This occurs with\\nvarious fungi responsible for plant disease, as well as certain parasites of animals. Among the latter are\\nspecies of the fungus Coccidioides , which infect both rodents and humans (producing desert fever in the\\nlatter), and the anthrax  bacillus, which causes disease in cattle, sheep, and other domesticated animals and\\noccasionally infects humans as well. A disease of animals that can be transmitted to humans is called a\\nzoonosis.\\nSurvival of the parasite ordinarily requires that it be transmitted more or less directly from an infected host\\norganism to a susceptible one. The precise route of infection often is of primary importance, with some\\nmicroor ganisms requiring direct access to internal tissue, some being able to initiate infection on mucous\\nmembranes of the nose and throat, and others able to establish primary infections in the intestinal tract. These\\nparticular modes of infection generally occur by way of, respectively , biting insects , coughing and sneezing,\\nand contamination of food and water .\\nThe occurrence of a given parasite in more than one host species may markedly af fect its epidemiological\\ncharacter; it may persist, for example, in one or another of its hosts as a reservoir of infection, sallying forth to\\nencounter the alternate host only on occasion. It is fairly common to find transmission of a parasite from one\\nvertebrate or plant host to another occurring by means of an insect carrier , or vector . Often animal parasites\\nhave intermediate hosts in which one or more phases of their life cycles occur; this results in an obligatory\\nsequence of hosts in the life history of the parasite. With the disease schistosomiasis  in humans, for example,\\nthe blood flukes  responsible for the disease ( Schistosoma  species) spend one phase of their larval life in\\nsnails . Under such circumstances, and they are not uncommon, the dissemination of the parasite in a host\\npopulation is dependent not only on the interaction of the parasite population with that of the host population\\nbut also on the interaction of the intermediate or vector host population with both parasite and host\\npopulations.\\nSuch interrelationships may be the basis of geographic and seasonal dif ferences in the incidence of disease.\\nAn insect-borne disease transmitted from one host species to another requires the simultaneous presence of all\\nthree populations in suf ficient numbers for its dissemination.

The\\nperiod of increase occurs when each case gives rise to more than one additional case—i.e., when the parasite\\npopulation is growing more rapidly than the host population. The decline occurs when each case gives rise to\\nless than one new case—i.e., when the parasite population begins to die of f because it encounters only\\nimmune individuals among the host population. The rise and fall in epidemic prevalence of a disease is a\\nprobability phenomenon, the probability being that of transfer of an ef fective dose of the infectious agent\\nfrom the infected individual to a susceptible one. After an epidemic wave has subsided, the af fected host\\npopulation contains such a small proportion of susceptible individuals that reintroduction of the infection will\\nnot result in a new epidemic. Because the parasite population cannot reproduce itself in such a host\\npopulation, the entire host population is immune to the epidemic disease, a phenomenon known as herd\\nimmunity .\\nFollowing such an epidemic, however , the host population immediately tends to revert to a condition of\\nsusceptibility because of (1) the deterioration of individual immunity , (2) the removal of immune individuals\\nby death, and (3) the influx of susceptible individuals by birth. In time the population as a whole again\\nreaches the point at which it is susceptible to epidemic disease. This pattern of rising and falling herd\\nimmunity explains why epidemic diseases tend to occur in waves—i.e., exhibit a periodicity in prevalence.\\nThe time elapsing between successive epidemic peaks is variable and dif fers from one disease to another .\\nImmunity\\nHumans and all other vertebrates react to the presence of\\nparasites within their tissues by means of immune mechanisms\\nof which there are two types: nonspecific, innate immunity and\\nspecific, acquired immunity . Innate immunity , with which an\\norganism is born, involves protective factors, such as interferon ,\\nand cells, such as macrophages, granulocytes , and natural killer\\ncells, and its action does not depend on prior exposure to a\\npathogen. Specific immunity is acquired during the or ganism’ s\\nlifetime and involves the activation of white blood cells  (B and T\\nlymphocytes ), which distinguish and react to foreign substances.\\nB lymphocytes (or B cells ) operate by producing antibodies ,\\nproteins that neutralize foreign molecules ( antigens ), while T lymphocytes (or T cells ) directly attack\\ninvaders. Many immune responses, however , involve both mechanisms.\\nAlthough the immune response is primarily defensive in nature, it may contribute in some cases to the\\npathogenesis of the disease. In rheumatic fever , for example, sensitivity to antigens of the causative\\nstreptococcus or ganism, which cross-react with host tissue antigens, is associated with the progress and\\nadverse aspects of the disease. The immune response to various environmental substances, such as plant\\npollens  and chemotherapeutic drugs , also is responsible for the diseases grouped under the general head of\\nallergies. The immune response itself may become deficient in human diseases involving white cells, such as\\nmultiple myeloma , macroglobulinemia, Hodgkin lymphoma , and chronic lymphocytic leukemia .

Examples of autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid\\narthritis  and systemic lupus erythematosus . (For a more detailed explanation of immune function and\\nautoimmunity , see immune system .)\\nContr ol of disease\\nPrevention\\nMost diseases are preventable to a greater or lesser degree, the chief exceptions being the idiopathic diseases,\\nsuch as the inherited metabolic defects. In the case of those diseases resulting from environmental exposures,\\nprevention is a matter of eliminating, or sharply reducing, the factors responsible in the environment. Because\\nchemicals and other substances and materials originate lar gely from human activities, prevention ought to be a\\nsimple matter of the application of well-established principles of industrial hygiene. In practice, however , this\\nis often dif ficult to achieve.\\nThe infectious diseases may be prevented in one of two general ways: (1) by preventing contact, and therefore\\ntransmission of infection, between the susceptible host and the source of infection and (2) by rendering the\\nhost unsusceptible, either by selective breeding or by induction of an ef fective artificial immunity . The nature\\nof the specific preventive measures, and their ef ficacy , varies from one disease to another .\\nQuarantine , which is an ef fective method of preventing transmission of disease in principle, has had only\\nlimited success in actual practice. In only a few instances has quarantine achieved prevention of the spread of\\ndisease across international borders, and quarantine of individual cases of human disease has long been\\nabandoned as inef fective.\\nIt has not been possible to prevent ef fectively the dissemination of airborne disease, notably airborne fungal\\ndiseases of plants and human diseases of the upper respiratory tract. Nor is disease ordinarily controllable by\\nelimination of reservoirs of infection, such as those that occur in wild animals. There are, however , certain\\nexceptions in which the reservoir of infection can be greatly reduced. For example, chemotherapy of human\\ntuberculosis may render individual cases noninfectious. The slaughtering of infected cattle may reduce the\\nincidence of bovine tuberculosis, while the culling of poultry can reduce the incidence of bird flu .\\nWhen infection is spread less directly , through the agency of living vectors or inanimate vehicles, it is often\\npossible to break one or more of the links connecting the susceptible host with the source of infection.

Under special circumstances,\\nas in certain military populations, it has been possible to control\\nwith prophylactic medicinal agents the spread of disease for\\nwhich ef fective vaccines have not been developed.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of disease in the af fected individual is twofold in nature, being directed (1) toward restoration of a\\nnormal physiological state and (2) toward removal of the causative agent. The diseased or ganism itself plays\\nan active part in both respects, having the capacity for tissue proliferation to replace damaged tissue and to\\nsurround and wall of f the noxious agent, as well as defense and detoxification mechanisms that remove the\\ncausative agent and its products or render them harmless. Therapy of disease supplements and reinforces these\\nnatural defense mechanisms.\\nMetabolic faults also may sometimes be corrected—for example, by the use of insulin  in the treatment and\\ncontrol of diabetes mellitus —but more often specific therapeutic measures for idiopathic diseases are lacking.\\nAdvances in gene therapy  and gene editing , however , may enable the correction of defective genes that result\\nin disease.\\nWhen disease is produced by environmental factors, there is commonly no specific treatment; only removal of\\nthe af fected individual from exposure to the agent generally allows normal detoxification responses to take\\nover. Again, there are notable exceptions, as in the treatment of lead poisoning  with\\nethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDT A), an agent that forms complexes with lead that are then excreted by\\nthe kidney .\\nTreatment of infectious diseases is more ef fective in general; it assumes several dif ferent forms. Treatment of\\ndiphtheria with antitoxin , for example, neutralizes the toxin formed by the microor ganisms, and host defense\\nmechanisms then rid the body of the causative microor ganisms. In other diseases, treatment is symptomatic in\\nthe sense of restoring normal body function. An outstanding example of this is in cholera, in which disease\\nsymptoms result from a massive loss of fluid and salts and from a metabolic acidosis ; the highly ef fective\\ntreatment consists of restoring water and salts, the latter including bicarbonates or lactates to combat acidosis.\\nMore often, however , therapy is directed against the infecting microor ganism by administration of drugs such\\nas sulfonamides  or antibiotics . While some of these substances kill the microor ganisms, others do not and\\ninstead inhibit proliferation of the microor ganism and give host defenses an opportunity to function\\neffectively . For other infectious diseases there is no specific therapy . There are, for example, very few\\nantiviral chemotherapeutic agents; treatment of viral diseases is mainly directed toward relief of discomfort\\nand pain, and recovery , if it ensues, is lar gely a matter of an ef fective cellular immune response mounted\\nagainst the invading virus by the host.10/10/24, 8:46 PM disease -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia\\nhttps://www.britannica.com/print/article/165521 11/12'),\n",

In addition,\\nepidemiologic studies may be classified as descriptive or analytic, depending on whether they are intended to\\ncharacterize disease or test conclusions drawn from descriptive surveys or laboratory observations.\\nInformation from epidemiologic studies frequently is used to plan new health services and to evaluate the\\noverall health status of a given population. In most countries of the world, public-health  authorities regularly\\ngather epidemiologic data on specific diseases and mortality rates in their populaces.\\nThe field of epidemiology is highly interdisciplinary . In addition to its close ties to statistics, particularly\\nbiostatistics, it relies heavily on the concepts, knowledge, and theories of such disciplines as biology ,\\npathology , and physiology  in the health and biomedical sciences as well as on the disciplines of anthropology ,\\npsychology , and sociology  in the behavioral and social sciences.\\nHistorical development\\nEpidemiology emer ged as a formal science in the 19th century . However , its historical development spanned\\ncenturies, in a process that was slow and unsteady and aided by the contributions of many individuals.\\nOne of the first major figures in the historical development of epidemiology was the ancient Greek physician\\nHippocrates , who is traditionally regarded as the father of medicine . Hippocrates is presumed to have written\\nthe Epidemics  and On Airs, W aters, and Places , works in which he attempted to explain the occurrence of\\ndisease on a rational rather than supernatural basis. Hippocrates recognized disease as a mass phenomenon as\\nwell as one af fecting individuals.\\nAnother significant contribution to the foundation of epidemiology was made in the 17th century , with the\\nwork of English statistician John Graunt . Graunt was the first person to analyze the bills of mortality , which\\nrecorded the weekly counts of christenings and deaths in London . In 1662 Graunt published the results of his\\nfindings in Natural and Political Observations...Made upon the Bills of Mortality . He found that although10/10/24, 8:35 PM epidemiology -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia\\nhttps://www.britannica.com/print/article/189810 1/6'),\n",

The transition occurred because males experienced higher mortality rates than\\nfemales. Graunt also constructed the first life table, a statistical table that uses death rates of a cohort (group)\\nof persons to determine the group’ s average life expectancy .\\nIn the 18th century British naval sur geon James Lind , through his studies of scurvy , added to the foundations\\nof epidemiology . On long naval voyages, scurvy could kill a significant proportion of a ship’ s crew . To study\\nthe prevention of scurvy , Lind conducted the first modern controlled clinical trial . Selecting 12 sailors who\\nwere ill with scurvy , Lind divided them into pairs, each pair receiving a dif ferent dietary supplement. One of\\nthe pairs was given lemons and oranges to eat, and within a week the two sailors’  symptoms had disappeared.\\nThe symptoms of the sailors on the other dietary regimens, however , persisted. Lind’ s findings ultimately\\ninfluenced the decision by the British navy to make lemon juice (later replaced by lime juice) a compulsory\\npart of sailors’  diets, which resulted in the eradication of scurvy from the British navy .\\nAlso in the 18th century sur geon Edward Jenner , who practiced medicine in the village of Berkeley in\\nGloucestershire , England, observed that persons who developed cowpox  (a mild disease) never contracted\\nsmallpox , a severe and often disfiguring and deadly disease. Jenner decided to test his observation by using\\nmatter drawn from cowpox lesions on the hand of a dairymaid to inoculate a young boy against smallpox.\\nWhen Jenner later exposed the boy to smallpox, the boy did not develop the disease. In that way Jenner\\nperformed what later became one of the most widely known vaccination trials for smallpox. In time the\\npractice of vaccinating for the prevention of smallpox became widespread, and vaccination in general became\\na widely used method to prevent the occurrence of many diseases. Vaccination against smallpox was notably\\nsuccessful; by 1980 the disease had been declared eradicated.\\nJenner ’s contributions to epidemiology were followed in the 19th century by those of William Farr , a British\\nphysician who worked as a compiler of abstracts at the Registrar General’ s Office (General Register Of fice) in\\nLondon. Farr ’s work helped shape England’ s vital statistics system. His most-important contribution to\\nepidemiology was the establishment of a sophisticated system for classifying the causes of death. That\\nenabled the comparison, for the first time, of mortality rates between dif ferent demographic and occupational\\ngroups. Farr ’s classification system provided the foundation for the International Classification of Diseases\\n(ICD), a tool used to classify causes of death and injury .\\nA great pioneer in the field of epidemiology was English physician John Snow . Snow was well respected in\\nLondon as a specialist in obstetric anesthesiology , having assisted Queen Victoria  in the delivery of two of her\\nchildren. Similar to other British physicians at the time, Snow became interested in the cause and spread of\\ncholera  epidemics that periodically occurred in London. In 1854, during the third epidemic to strike the city ,\\nSnow began his investigations. At the time, most physicians attributed the disease to miasma, or bad air ,\\nformed from the decay of or ganic matter . Snow , however , held the radical view at the time that cholera was\\ncaused by contact with germ-contaminated matter , particularly water . Snow identified a lar ge number of\\ndeaths clustered around a public water hand pump on Broad Street in the Soho District of west London. He\\ninformed the local authorities and explained his hunch as to the cause. Although the authorities were\\nskeptical, the next day they had the pump disabled by removing its handle.

However , because cholera deaths were already declining in the city , Snow was\\nunable to attribute the end of the outbreak directly to the removal of the pump handle.\\nSnow continued his investigations, however , and in 1854 he also conducted his so-called “Grand\\nExperiment.” Snow painstakingly documented cholera deaths among the subscribers of London’ s two\\nindependent private water companies. The Southwark and Vauxhall Company drew its water from sewage-\\npolluted inlets of the River Thames  in London, whereas the Lambeth Company obtained its water from the\\nupper portion of the river , some distance from urban pollution. Snow showed that cholera deaths were higher\\nfor residents in homes served by the Southwark and Vauxhall Company than for residents in locations served\\nby the Lambeth Company . Because of his study methods and insight, Snow is generally regarded as the father\\nof modern epidemiology .\\nBasic concepts and tools\\nEpidemiology is based on two fundamental assumptions. First, the occurrence of disease is not random (i.e.,\\nvarious factors influence the likelihood of developing disease). Second, the study of populations enables the\\nidentification of the causes and preventive factors associated with disease. To investigate disease in\\npopulations, epidemiologists rely on models and definitions of disease occurrence and employ various tools,\\nthe most basic of which are rates.\\nEpidemiological models\\nEpidemiologists often use models to explain the occurrence of disease. One commonly used model views\\ndisease in terms of susceptibility and exposure factors. In order for individuals to develop a disease, they must\\nbe both susceptible to the disease and exposed to the disease. For example, for a person to develop measles\\n(rubeola), a highly infectious viral disease that was once common among children, the individual must be\\nexposed to a person who is shedding the measles virus  (an active case) and must lack immunity to the disease.\\nImmunity to measles may be derived from either previously having had the disease or from having been\\nvaccinated against it.\\nAnother commonly used model, the epidemiologic triad (or epidemiologic triangle), views the occurrence of\\ndisease as the balance of host, agent, and environment factors. The host is the actual or potential recipient or\\nvictim of the disease. Hosts have characteristics that either predispose them to or protect them from disease.\\nThose characteristics may be biological (e.g., age, sex, and degree of immunity), behavioral (e.g., habits,\\nculture, and lifestyle), or social (e.g., attitudes, norms, and values). The agent is the factor that causes disease.\\nAgents may be biological (e.g., bacteria  and fungi ), chemical (e.g., gases and natural or synthetic\\ncompounds), nutritional (e.g., food additives ), or physical (e.g., ionizing radiation ). The environment includes\\nall external factors, other than the host and agent, that influence health. The environment may be categorized\\nas the social environment (e.g., economic, legal, and political), the physical environment (e.g., weather\\nconditions), or the biological environment (e.g., animals  and plants ). To illustrate the epidemiologic triad, a\\ncase of lung cancer  may be considered. The host is the person who developed lung cancer . He or she may\\nhave had the habit of smoking  for many years. The agents are the smoke and the tars and toxic chemicals\\ncontained in the tobacco . The environment may have been the workplace where smoking on the job was\\npermitted and sites where cigarettes  or other tobacco products were readily available.10/10/24, 8:35 PM epidemiology -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia\\nhttps://www.britannica.com/print/article/189810 3/6'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdf_files\\\\epidemiology -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='Definitions of disease occurr ence\\nEpidemiologists classify the type of disease cases and frequency of disease occurrence within a population as\\nbeing either endemic or epidemic . Endemic is defined as the usual occurrence of a disease within a\\npopulation. In contrast, an epidemic is a sudden and great increase in the occurrence of a disease within a\\npopulation. It may also be the first occurrence of an entirely new disease. An epidemic can give rise to a\\npandemic , which is a rapidly emer ging outbreak of a disease that af fects populations across a wide\\ngeographical area. Pandemics often are worldwide in scope. As an illustration of the three types: small\\nnumbers of people may be af fected by influenza  throughout the year in a lar ge city; those individuals would\\nbe considered endemic cases of the disease. If the number of people af fected by influenza in the same city\\nincreases to high levels in the winter , the outbreak would be considered an epidemic. If a new variety of\\ninfluenza emer ges and af fects people throughout the world, the outbreak would be considered a pandemic. An\\nexample of a pandemic is the influenza pandemic of 1918–19 , which spread to countries worldwide and killed\\nan estimated 20 million–50 million people.\\nCrude, specific, and adjusted rates\\nEpidemiological rates may be crude, specific, or adjusted (standardized). Crude rates use the total number of\\ndisease cases and the entire population in their calculations. Specific rates dif ferentiate cases and populations\\nby cause, age, sex, race, or other factors. Adjusted rates allow for the comparison of populations with dif ferent\\ncharacteristics.\\nMorbidity and mortality rates\\nThe analysis of morbidity and mortality caused by acute and chronic diseases forms the basis of many\\nepidemiological studies. Morbidity represents the illness, symptoms, or impairments produced by a disease,\\nwhereas mortality is death caused by a disease. Acute diseases are those that strike and disappear quickly ,\\nwithin a month or so (e.g., chickenpox  and influenza). Chronic diseases are those that are long-term; chronic\\ndiseases often are incurable (e.g., many forms of cancer  and diabetes mellitus ).\\nMorbidity and mortality rates allow researchers to compare disease cases and deaths to the unit size of\\npopulation. A rate is a special type of proportion that includes a specification of time, and the numerator of the\\nproportion is included in the denominator . Rates can be expressed in any form that is convenient (e.g., per\\n1,000, per 10,000, or per 100,000). Infant mortality rates, for example, are typically expressed per 1,000 live\\nbirths, whereas cancer rates are expressed per 100,000 population.\\nIncidence and pr evalence rates\\nThe occurrence of disease can be measured by using incidence rates and prevalence rates.

It describes\\nthe person, place, and time characteristics of disease occurrence. Analytical epidemiology , on the other hand,\\nis used to test hypotheses to determine whether statistical associations exist between suspected causal factors\\nand disease occurrence. It also is used to test the ef fectiveness and safety of therapeutic and medical\\ninterventions. The tests of analytical epidemiology are carried out through four major types of research study\\ndesigns: cross-sectional studies, case-control studies , cohort studies, and controlled clinical trials.\\nCross-sectional studies are used to explore associations of disease with variables of interest. For example, a\\ncross-sectional study designed to investigate whether residential exposure to the radioactive gas radon\\nincreases the risk of lung cancer may examine the level of radon gas in the homes of lung cancer patients.\\nCross-sectional studies have the advantage of being inexpensive and simple to conduct.

Case-control studies are most useful for ascertaining the cause of rare events, such as rare\\ncancers. Case-control studies have the advantages of being quick to conduct and inexpensive, and they require\\nonly a small number of cases and controls.

Unlike other medical disciplines,\\nepidemiology concerns itself with groups of people\\nrather than individual patients and is frequently\\nretrospective, or historical, in nature. It developed out\\nof the search for causes of human disease  in the 19th\\ncentury , and one of its chief functions remains the\\nidentification of populations at high risk for a given\\ndisease so that the cause may be identified and\\npreventive measures implemented.\\nA variety of tools, including mortality rates and incidence  and prevalence  rates, are used in the field of\\nepidemiology to better understand the characteristics of disease within and across populations. In addition,\\nepidemiologic studies may be classified as descriptive or analytic, depending on whether they are intended to\\ncharacterize disease or test conclusions drawn from descriptive surveys or laboratory observations.\\nInformation from epidemiologic studies frequently is used to plan new health services and to evaluate the\\noverall health status of a given population. In most countries of the world, public-health  authorities regularly\\ngather epidemiologic data on specific diseases and mortality rates in their populaces.\\nThe field of epidemiology is highly interdisciplinary . In addition to its close ties to statistics, particularly\\nbiostatistics, it relies heavily on the concepts, knowledge, and theories of such disciplines as biology ,\\npathology , and physiology  in the health and biomedical sciences as well as on the disciplines of anthropology ,\\npsychology , and sociology  in the behavioral and social sciences.\\nHistorical development\\nEpidemiology emer ged as a formal science in the 19th century . However , its historical development spanned\\ncenturies, in a process that was slow and unsteady and aided by the contributions of many individuals.\\nOne of the first major figures in the historical development of epidemiology was the ancient Greek physician\\nHippocrates , who is traditionally regarded as the father of medicine . Hippocrates is presumed to have written\\nthe Epidemics  and On Airs, W aters, and Places , works in which he attempted to explain the occurrence of\\ndisease on a rational rather than supernatural basis. Hippocrates recognized disease as a mass phenomenon as\\nwell as one af fecting individuals.\\nAnother significant contribution to the foundation of epidemiology was made in the 17th century , with the\\nwork of English statistician John Graunt . Graunt was the first person to analyze the bills of mortality , which\\nrecorded the weekly counts of christenings and deaths in London . In 1662 Graunt published the results of his\\nfindings in Natural and Political Observations...Made upon the Bills of Mortality . He found that although10/10/24, 8:47 PM epidemiology -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia\\nhttps://www.britannica.com/print/article/189810 1/6'),\n",

The transition occurred because males experienced higher mortality rates than\\nfemales. Graunt also constructed the first life table, a statistical table that uses death rates of a cohort (group)\\nof persons to determine the group’ s average life expectancy .\\nIn the 18th century British naval sur geon James Lind , through his studies of scurvy , added to the foundations\\nof epidemiology . On long naval voyages, scurvy could kill a significant proportion of a ship’ s crew . To study\\nthe prevention of scurvy , Lind conducted the first modern controlled clinical trial . Selecting 12 sailors who\\nwere ill with scurvy , Lind divided them into pairs, each pair receiving a dif ferent dietary supplement. One of\\nthe pairs was given lemons and oranges to eat, and within a week the two sailors’  symptoms had disappeared.\\nThe symptoms of the sailors on the other dietary regimens, however , persisted. Lind’ s findings ultimately\\ninfluenced the decision by the British navy to make lemon juice (later replaced by lime juice) a compulsory\\npart of sailors’  diets, which resulted in the eradication of scurvy from the British navy .\\nAlso in the 18th century sur geon Edward Jenner , who practiced medicine in the village of Berkeley in\\nGloucestershire , England, observed that persons who developed cowpox  (a mild disease) never contracted\\nsmallpox , a severe and often disfiguring and deadly disease. Jenner decided to test his observation by using\\nmatter drawn from cowpox lesions on the hand of a dairymaid to inoculate a young boy against smallpox.\\nWhen Jenner later exposed the boy to smallpox, the boy did not develop the disease. In that way Jenner\\nperformed what later became one of the most widely known vaccination trials for smallpox. In time the\\npractice of vaccinating for the prevention of smallpox became widespread, and vaccination in general became\\na widely used method to prevent the occurrence of many diseases. Vaccination against smallpox was notably\\nsuccessful; by 1980 the disease had been declared eradicated.\\nJenner ’s contributions to epidemiology were followed in the 19th century by those of William Farr , a British\\nphysician who worked as a compiler of abstracts at the Registrar General’ s Office (General Register Of fice) in\\nLondon. Farr ’s work helped shape England’ s vital statistics system. His most-important contribution to\\nepidemiology was the establishment of a sophisticated system for classifying the causes of death. That\\nenabled the comparison, for the first time, of mortality rates between dif ferent demographic and occupational\\ngroups. Farr ’s classification system provided the foundation for the International Classification of Diseases\\n(ICD), a tool used to classify causes of death and injury .\\nA great pioneer in the field of epidemiology was English physician John Snow . Snow was well respected in\\nLondon as a specialist in obstetric anesthesiology , having assisted Queen Victoria  in the delivery of two of her\\nchildren. Similar to other British physicians at the time, Snow became interested in the cause and spread of\\ncholera  epidemics that periodically occurred in London. In 1854, during the third epidemic to strike the city ,\\nSnow began his investigations. At the time, most physicians attributed the disease to miasma, or bad air ,\\nformed from the decay of or ganic matter . Snow , however , held the radical view at the time that cholera was\\ncaused by contact with germ-contaminated matter , particularly water . Snow identified a lar ge number of\\ndeaths clustered around a public water hand pump on Broad Street in the Soho District of west London. He\\ninformed the local authorities and explained his hunch as to the cause. Although the authorities were\\nskeptical, the next day they had the pump disabled by removing its handle. Almost immediately , new cases of10/10/24, 8:47 PM epidemiology -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia\\nhttps://www.britannica.com/print/article/189810 2/6'),\n",

However , because cholera deaths were already declining in the city , Snow was\\nunable to attribute the end of the outbreak directly to the removal of the pump handle.\\nSnow continued his investigations, however , and in 1854 he also conducted his so-called “Grand\\nExperiment.” Snow painstakingly documented cholera deaths among the subscribers of London’ s two\\nindependent private water companies. The Southwark and Vauxhall Company drew its water from sewage-\\npolluted inlets of the River Thames  in London, whereas the Lambeth Company obtained its water from the\\nupper portion of the river , some distance from urban pollution. Snow showed that cholera deaths were higher\\nfor residents in homes served by the Southwark and Vauxhall Company than for residents in locations served\\nby the Lambeth Company . Because of his study methods and insight, Snow is generally regarded as the father\\nof modern epidemiology .\\nBasic concepts and tools\\nEpidemiology is based on two fundamental assumptions. First, the occurrence of disease is not random (i.e.,\\nvarious factors influence the likelihood of developing disease). Second, the study of populations enables the\\nidentification of the causes and preventive factors associated with disease. To investigate disease in\\npopulations, epidemiologists rely on models and definitions of disease occurrence and employ various tools,\\nthe most basic of which are rates.\\nEpidemiological models\\nEpidemiologists often use models to explain the occurrence of disease. One commonly used model views\\ndisease in terms of susceptibility and exposure factors. In order for individuals to develop a disease, they must\\nbe both susceptible to the disease and exposed to the disease. For example, for a person to develop measles\\n(rubeola), a highly infectious viral disease that was once common among children, the individual must be\\nexposed to a person who is shedding the measles virus  (an active case) and must lack immunity to the disease.\\nImmunity to measles may be derived from either previously having had the disease or from having been\\nvaccinated against it.\\nAnother commonly used model, the epidemiologic triad (or epidemiologic triangle), views the occurrence of\\ndisease as the balance of host, agent, and environment factors. The host is the actual or potential recipient or\\nvictim of the disease. Hosts have characteristics that either predispose them to or protect them from disease.\\nThose characteristics may be biological (e.g., age, sex, and degree of immunity), behavioral (e.g., habits,\\nculture, and lifestyle), or social (e.g., attitudes, norms, and values). The agent is the factor that causes disease.\\nAgents may be biological (e.g., bacteria  and fungi ), chemical (e.g., gases and natural or synthetic\\ncompounds), nutritional (e.g., food additives ), or physical (e.g., ionizing radiation ). The environment includes\\nall external factors, other than the host and agent, that influence health. The environment may be categorized\\nas the social environment (e.g., economic, legal, and political), the physical environment (e.g., weather\\nconditions), or the biological environment (e.g., animals  and plants ). To illustrate the epidemiologic triad, a\\ncase of lung cancer  may be considered. The host is the person who developed lung cancer . He or she may\\nhave had the habit of smoking  for many years. The agents are the smoke and the tars and toxic chemicals\\ncontained in the tobacco . The environment may have been the workplace where smoking on the job was\\npermitted and sites where cigarettes  or other tobacco products were readily available.10/10/24, 8:47 PM epidemiology -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia\\nhttps://www.britannica.com/print/article/189810 3/6'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdf_files\\\\epidemiology -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia1.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='Definitions of disease occurr ence\\nEpidemiologists classify the type of disease cases and frequency of disease occurrence within a population as\\nbeing either endemic or epidemic . Endemic is defined as the usual occurrence of a disease within a\\npopulation. In contrast, an epidemic is a sudden and great increase in the occurrence of a disease within a\\npopulation. It may also be the first occurrence of an entirely new disease. An epidemic can give rise to a\\npandemic , which is a rapidly emer ging outbreak of a disease that af fects populations across a wide\\ngeographical area. Pandemics often are worldwide in scope. As an illustration of the three types: small\\nnumbers of people may be af fected by influenza  throughout the year in a lar ge city; those individuals would\\nbe considered endemic cases of the disease. If the number of people af fected by influenza in the same city\\nincreases to high levels in the winter , the outbreak would be considered an epidemic. If a new variety of\\ninfluenza emer ges and af fects people throughout the world, the outbreak would be considered a pandemic. An\\nexample of a pandemic is the influenza pandemic of 1918–19 , which spread to countries worldwide and killed\\nan estimated 20 million–50 million people.\\nCrude, specific, and adjusted rates\\nEpidemiological rates may be crude, specific, or adjusted (standardized). Crude rates use the total number of\\ndisease cases and the entire population in their calculations. Specific rates dif ferentiate cases and populations\\nby cause, age, sex, race, or other factors. Adjusted rates allow for the comparison of populations with dif ferent\\ncharacteristics.\\nMorbidity and mortality rates\\nThe analysis of morbidity and mortality caused by acute and chronic diseases forms the basis of many\\nepidemiological studies. Morbidity represents the illness, symptoms, or impairments produced by a disease,\\nwhereas mortality is death caused by a disease. Acute diseases are those that strike and disappear quickly ,\\nwithin a month or so (e.g., chickenpox  and influenza). Chronic diseases are those that are long-term; chronic\\ndiseases often are incurable (e.g., many forms of cancer  and diabetes mellitus ).\\nMorbidity and mortality rates allow researchers to compare disease cases and deaths to the unit size of\\npopulation. A rate is a special type of proportion that includes a specification of time, and the numerator of the\\nproportion is included in the denominator . Rates can be expressed in any form that is convenient (e.g., per\\n1,000, per 10,000, or per 100,000). Infant mortality rates, for example, are typically expressed per 1,000 live\\nbirths, whereas cancer rates are expressed per 100,000 population.\\nIncidence and pr evalence rates\\nThe occurrence of disease can be measured by using incidence rates and prevalence rates. The incidence rate\\nmeasures the occurrence of new cases of a disease in a population over a period of time. The incidence rate is\\nan important measure for evaluating disease-control programs and has implications for the future problems of\\nmedical care. For example, the calculation of incidence rates of HIV/ AIDS  provides insight into whether the\\ndisease is spreading and whether HIV -prevention programs are working.10/10/24, 8:47 PM epidemiology -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia\\nhttps://www.britannica.com/print/article/189810 4/6'),\n",

Genetics forms one of the central pillars of\\nbiology  and overlaps with many other areas, such as\\nagriculture, medicine , and biotechnology .\\nSince the dawn of civilization, humankind has\\nrecognized the influence of heredity and applied its\\nprinciples to the improvement of cultivated crops and\\ndomestic animals. A Babylonian tablet more than\\n6,000 years old, for example, shows pedigree s of\\nhorses and indicates possible inherited\\ncharacteristics. Other old carvings show cross-\\npollination  of date palm trees. Most of the\\nmechanisms of heredity , however , remained a mystery until the 19th century , when genetics as a systematic\\nscience began.\\nGenetics arose out of the identification of genes, the fundamental units responsible for heredity . Genetics may\\nbe defined as the study of gene s at all levels, including the ways in which they act in the cell and the ways in\\nwhich they are transmitted from parents to of fspring. Modern genetics focuses on the chemical substance that\\ngenes are made of, called deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA , and the ways in which it af fects the chemical\\nreactions that constitute the living processes within the cell. Gene action depends on interaction with the\\nenvironment. Green plant s, for example, have genes containing the information necessary to synthesize the\\nphotosynthetic pigment chlorophyll  that gives them their green colour . Chlorophyll is synthesized in an\\nenvironment containing light because the gene for chlorophyll is expressed only when it interacts with light. If\\na plant is placed in a dark environment, chlorophyll synthesis stops because the gene is no longer expressed.\\nGenetics as a scientific discipline stemmed from the work of Gregor Mendel  in the middle of the 19th century .\\nMendel suspected that traits were inherited as discrete units, and, although he knew nothing of the physical or\\nchemical nature of genes at the time, his units became the basis for the development of the present\\nunderstanding of heredity . All present research in genetics can be traced back to Mendel’ s discovery of the\\nlaws governing the inheritance of traits. The word genetics  was introduced in 1905 by English biologist\\nWilliam Bateson , who was one of the discoverers of Mendel’ s work and who became a champion of Mendel’ s\\nprinciples of inheritance.\\nHistorical backgr ound\\nAncient theories of pangenesis and blood in her edity\\nAlthough scientific evidence for patterns of genetic inheritance did not appear until Mendel’ s work, history\\nshows that humankind must have been interested in heredity long before the dawn of civilization.

Such notions were instrumental in the establishment of family and royal dynasties. Early\\nnomadic tribes  were interested in the qualities of the animals that they herded and domesticated and,\\nundoubtedly , bred selectively . The first human settlements that practiced farming appear to have selected crop\\nplants with favourable qualities. Ancient tomb paintings show racehorse breeding pedigrees containing clear\\ndepictions of the inheritance of several distinct physical traits in the horses. Despite this interest, the first\\nrecorded speculations on heredity did not exist until the time of the ancient Greeks; some aspects of their\\nideas are still considered relevant today .\\nHippocrates  (c. 460– c. 375 BCE), known as the father of medicine, believed in the inheritance of acquired\\ncharacteristics, and, to account for this, he devised the hypothesis known as pangenesis. He postulated that all\\norgans of the body of a parent gave of f invisible “seeds,” which were like miniaturized building components\\nand were transmitted during sexual intercourse, reassembling themselves in the mother ’s womb to form a\\nbaby .\\nAristotle  (384–322 BCE) emphasized the importance of blood  in heredity . He thought that the blood supplied\\ngenerative material for building all parts of the adult body , and he reasoned that blood was the basis for\\npassing on this generative power to the next generation. In fact, he believed that the male’ s semen was\\npurified blood and that a woman’ s menstrual blood was her equivalent of semen. These male and female\\ncontributions united in the womb to produce a baby . The blood contained some type of hereditary essences,\\nbut he believed that the baby would develop under the influence of these essences, rather than being built\\nfrom the essences themselves.\\nAristotle’ s ideas about the role of blood in procreation were probably the origin of the still prevalent notion\\nthat somehow the blood is involved in heredity . Today people still speak of certain traits as being “in the\\nblood” and of “blood lines” and “blood ties.” The Greek model of inheritance, in which a teeming multitude\\nof substances was invoked, dif fered from that of the Mendelian model. Mendel’ s idea was that distinct\\ndifferences between individuals are determined by dif ferences in single yet powerful hereditary factors. These\\nsingle hereditary factors were identified as genes. Copies of genes are transmitted through sperm and egg and\\nguide the development of the of fspring. Genes are also responsible for reproducing the distinct features of\\nboth parents that are visible in their children.\\nPreformation and natural selection\\nIn the two millennia between the lives of Aristotle  and Mendel , few new ideas were recorded on the nature of\\nheredity . In the 17th and 18th centuries the idea of preformation was introduced. Scientists using the newly\\ndeveloped  microscope s imagined that they could see miniature replicas of human beings inside sperm heads.\\nFrench biologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck  invoked the idea of “the inheritance of acquired characters,” not as an\\nexplanation for heredity but as a model for evolution . He lived at a time when the fixity of species was taken\\nfor granted, yet he maintained that this fixity was only found in a constant environment. He enunciated the\\nlaw of use and disuse, which states that when certain or gans become specially developed as a result of some\\nenvironmental need, then that state of development is hereditary and can be passed on to progeny . He believed\\nthat in this way , over many generations, giraffes could arise from deerlike animals that had to keep stretching\\ntheir necks to reach high leaves on trees.10/10/24, 8:48 PM genetics -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia\\nhttps://www.britannica.com/print/article/228936 2/14'),\n",

Many scientists at the time believed in a hereditary mechanism that was a version of the\\nancient Greek idea of pangenesis, and Darwin’ s ideas did not appear to fit with the theory of heredity that\\nsprang from the experiments of Mendel.\\nThe work of Mendel\\nBefore Gregor Mendel , theories for a hereditary mechanism were based lar gely on logic and speculation, not\\non experimentation. In his monastery garden, Mendel carried out a lar ge number of cross-pollination\\nexperiments between variants of the garden pea, which he obtained as pure-breeding lines. He crossed peas\\nwith yellow seeds to those with green seeds and observed that the progeny seeds (the first generation, F 1)\\nwere all yellow . When the F 1 individuals were self-pollinated or crossed among themselves, their progeny\\n(F2) showed a ratio of 3:1 (3/4 yellow and 1/4 green). He deduced that, since the F 2 generation contained\\nsome green individuals, the determinants of greenness must have been present in the F 1 generation, although\\nthey were not expressed because yellow is dominant over green. From the precise mathematical 3:1 ratio (of\\nwhich he found several other examples), he deduced not only the existence of discrete hereditary units (genes)\\nbut also that the units were present in pairs in the pea plant and that the pairs separated during gamete\\nformation. Hence, the two original lines of pea plants were proposed to be YY (yellow) and yy (green). The\\ngametes from these were Y and y, thereby producing an F 1 generation of Yy that were yellow in colour\\nbecause of the dominance of Y. In the F 1 generation, half the gametes were Y and the other half were y,\\nmaking the F 2 generation produced from random mating 1/4 Yy, 1/2 YY, and 1/4 yy, thus explaining the 3:1\\nratio. The forms of the pea colour genes, Y and y, are called alleles .\\nMendel also analyzed pure lines that dif fered in pairs of characters, such as seed colour (yellow versus green)\\nand seed shape (round versus wrinkled). The cross of yellow round seeds with green wrinkled seeds resulted\\nin an F 1 generation that were all yellow and round, revealing the dominance of the yellow and round traits.\\nHowever , the F 2 generation produced by self-pollination of F 1 plants showed a ratio of 9:3:3:1 (9/16 yellow\\nround, 3/16 yellow wrinkled, 3/16 green round, and 1/16 green wrinkled; note that a 9:3:3:1 ratio is simply\\ntwo 3:1 ratios combined). From this result and others like it, he deduced the independent assortment of\\nseparate gene pairs at gamete formation.\\nMendel’ s success can be attributed in part to his classic experimental approach. He chose his experimental\\norganism well and performed many controlled experiments to collect data. From his results, he developed\\nbrilliant explanatory hypotheses and went on to test these hypotheses experimentally .

The 20th century saw tremendous strides in the development of the understanding of the nature of\\ngene s and how they function. Mendel’ s publications lay unmentioned in the research literature until 1900,\\nwhen the same conclusions were reached by several other investigators. Then there followed hundreds of\\npapers showing Mendelian inheritance in a wide array of plants and animals, including humans. It seemed\\nthat Mendel’ s ideas were of general validity . Many biologists noted that the inheritance of genes closely\\nparalleled the inheritance of chromosome s during nuclear divisions, called meiosis , that occur in the cell\\ndivisions just prior to gamete  formation.\\nThe discovery of linked genes\\nIt seemed that genes were parts of chromosomes. In 1910 this\\nidea was strengthened through the demonstration of parallel\\ninheritance of certain Drosophila  (a type of fruit fly) genes on\\nsex-determining chromosomes by American zoologist and\\ngeneticist Thomas Hunt Mor gan. Mor gan and one of his\\nstudents, Alfred Henry Sturtevant , showed not only that certain\\ngenes seemed to be linked on the same chromosome but that the\\ndistance between genes on the same chromosome could be\\ncalculated by measuring the frequency at which new\\nchromosomal combinations arose (these were proposed to be\\ncaused by chromosomal breakage and reunion, also known as\\ncrossing over). In 1916 another student of Mor gan’s, Calvin\\nBridges , used fruit flies with an extra chromosome to prove\\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the only way to explain the\\nabnormal inheritance of certain genes was if they were part of\\nthe extra chromosome. American geneticist Hermann Joseph Müller  showed that new alleles (called\\nmutation s) could be produced at high frequencies by treating cells with X-rays , the first demonstration of an\\nenvironmental mutagenic agent (mutations can also arise spontaneously). In 1931 American botanist Harriet\\nCreighton and American scientist Barbara McClintock  demonstrated that new allelic combinations of linked\\ngenes were correlated with physically exchanged chromosome parts.\\nEarly molecular  genetics\\nIn 1908 British physician Archibald Garrod proposed the important idea that the human disease alkaptonuria ,\\nand certain other hereditary diseases, were caused by inborn errors of metabolism , suggesting for the first\\ntime that linked genes had molecular action at the cell level. Molecular genetics did not begin in earnest until\\n1941 when American geneticist Geor ge Beadle  and American biochemist Edward Tatum  showed that the\\ngenes they were studying in the fungus Neur ospora crassa  acted by coding for catalytic proteins called\\nenzymes . Subsequent studies in other or ganisms extended this idea to show that genes generally code for\\nprotein s.

Watson  and\\nBritish biophysicists Francis Crick  and Maurice Wilkins  devised a double helix model for DNA  structure.\\nTheir breakthrough was made possible by the work of British scientist Rosalind Franklin , whose X-ray\\ndiffraction studies of the DNA  molecule shed light on its helical structure. The double helix model showed\\nthat DNA  was capable of self-replication by separating its complementary strands and using them as\\ntemplates for the synthesis of new DNA  molecules. Each of the intertwined strands of DNA  was proposed to\\nbe a chain of chemical groups called nucleotide s, of which there were known to be four types. Because\\nproteins are strings of amino acid s, it was proposed that a specific nucleotide sequence of DNA  could contain\\na code for an amino acid sequence and hence protein structure. In 1955 American molecular biologist\\nSeymour Benzer , extending earlier studies in Drosophila , showed that the mutant sites within a gene could be\\nmapped in relation to each other . His linear map indicated that the gene itself is a linear structure.\\nIn 1958 the strand-separation method for DNA  replication (called the semiconservative method) was\\ndemonstrated experimentally for the first time by American molecular biologist Matthew Meselson  and\\nAmerican geneticist Franklin W. Stahl . In 1961 Crick and South African biologist Sydney Brenner  showed\\nthat the genetic code  must be read in triplets of nucleotides, called codons. American geneticist Charles\\nYanofsky  showed that the positions of mutant sites within a gene matched perfectly the positions of altered\\namino acids in the amino acid sequence of the corresponding protein. In 1966 the complete genetic code of all\\n64 possible triplet coding units (codons), and the specific amino acids they code for , was deduced by\\nAmerican biochemists Marshall Nirenber g and Har Gobind Khorana . Subsequent studies in many or ganisms\\nshowed that the double helical structure of DNA, the mode of its replication, and the genetic code are the\\nsame in virtually all or ganisms, including plant s, animal s, fungi , bacteria , and virus es. In 1961 French\\nbiologist François Jacob  and French biochemist Jacques Monod  established the prototypical model for gene\\nregulation by showing that bacterial genes can be turned on (initiating transcription into RNA  and protein\\nsynthesis) and of f through the binding action of regulatory proteins to a region just upstream of the coding\\nregion of the gene.\\nRecombinant DNA  technology and the polymerase chain r eaction\\nTechnical advances have played an important role in the advance of genetic understanding.

In one approach, cells are ground up and the substituent chemicals are fractionated\\nfor further analysis.

The two strains can be distinguished by placing them on a thiamin-free mixture: those that\\ngrow have the gene for the enzyme, those that fail to grow do not. The technique also is applied to human\\ncells, since many inherited human abnormalities are caused by a faulty gene that fails to produce a vital\\nenzyme; albinism , which results from an inability to produce the pigment melanin  in the skin, hair , or iris of\\nthe eyes, is an example of an enzyme deficiency in man.10/10/24, 8:48 PM genetics -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia\\nhttps://www.britannica.com/print/article/228936 11/14'),\n",

Many dif ferent types of human genetic diseases can be\\ndetected in embryos as young as 12 weeks; the procedure involves removal and testing of a small amount of\\nfluid from around the embryo (called amniocentesis ) or of tissue from the placenta (called chorionic villus\\nsampling).\\nGene therapy is based on modification of defective genotypes by adding functional genes made through\\nrecombinant DNA  technology . Bioinformatics is being used to “mine” the human genome for gene products\\nthat might be candidates for designer pharmaceutical  drugs.\\nAgricultur e and animal husbandry\\nAgriculture and animal husbandry apply genetic techniques to\\nimprove plant s and animal s. Breeding analysis and transgenic\\nmodification using recombinant DNA  techniques are routinely\\nused. Animal breeders use artificial insemination  to propagate\\nthe genes of prize bulls. Prize cows can transmit their genes to\\nhundreds of of fspring by hormone  treatment, which stimulates\\nthe release of many eggs that are collected, fertilized, and\\ntransplanted to foster mothers. Several types of mammals can be\\ncloned, meaning that multiple identical copies can be produced\\nof certain desirable types.\\nPlant geneticists use special techniques to produce new species,\\nsuch as hybrid  grains (i.e., produced by crossing wheat  and rye),\\nand plants resistant to destruction by insect  and fungal  pests.10/10/24, 8:48 PM genetics -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia\\nhttps://www.britannica.com/print/article/228936 13/14'),\n",

Viruses are obligatory intracellular\\nparasites, capable of multiplying only within the cells of the host,\\nand they have no independent metabolic activity of their own.\\nThe genetic information that directs the synthesis of virus\\nmaterials and certain enzymes enters the host cell, parasitizes its\\nchemical processes, and directs them toward the synthesis of new virus elements.\\nThese various degrees of parasitism suggest that the host-parasite relationship is subject to continuing\\nevolutionary change. The adaptation of the microor ganism to its parasitic existence, in this view , is\\naccompanied by progressive loss in metabolic capability , with eventual complete physiological dependence of\\nthe parasite on the host.\\nParasite specificity\\nThe condition of obligate parasitism is associated with a degree of specificity of the parasite with regard to the\\nhost; i.e., the parasite generally is more closely adapted to one species of host than to all others.\\nMicroor ganisms adapted to plant hosts, with only rare exception, are unable to infect animal hosts, and\\nconversely microor ganism parasites of animals rarely occur in plants. A number of host species may be\\nsusceptible to infection with a given parasite, and the pattern of host susceptibility need not correspond with\\ntaxonomic relationships, including hosts varying as widely as vertebrates  and invertebrates .\\nThe ability to produce consistently fatal disease in a host is often of negative survival value to the parasite,\\nbecause it is quite likely to eliminate quickly all available hosts. Consistent with this, there is a tendency for\\ndisease resulting from infection to be less severe when adaptation of the parasite to the host has become close.\\nA change in severity of a disease, presumably resulting from adaptation , has been observed in the case of the\\nspirochete  that causes syphilis , with the disease in humans being less severe today than it was in the 16th\\ncentury . However , ecological studies of parasitism indicate that it is incorrect to assume that all host-parasite\\nrelationships will evolve toward reduced antagonism and that a resultant disease state eventually will be\\nameliorated. (For further information see community ecology .)\\nDisease produced in related host species may be either milder or more severe than in the definitive host. In\\ncertain cases, adaptation is so close that the parasite is unable to infect any other hosts under natural\\nconditions; this is true of many microor ganisms producing disease in humans. On the other hand, natural\\ninfection of secondary hosts may occur , leading to severe or fatal disease. Rabies , for example, is a fatal')"

      "AIMessage(content=\"Don't worry, I'm here to help.  If you or someone you know has diabetes, there are several treatment options available. The main goal of treatment is to manage blood sugar levels and prevent complications.\\n\\nHere are some general treatment options for diabetes:\\n\\n1. **Adjusting insulin dosage**: If you're taking insulin, your doctor may adjust the dosage based on your blood glucose levels and physical activity.\\n2. **Adjusting oral antidiabetic medications**: If you're taking oral medications, your doctor may adjust the dosage and take into account any potential interactions with other medications.\\n3. **Eating a balanced diet**: It's essential to eat regular meals and increase your carbohydrate intake if necessary. Avoid missing meals to prevent low blood sugar levels.\\n4. **Monitoring blood glucose levels**: Regularly checking your blood glucose levels will help you and your doctor adjust your treatment plan as needed.\\n\\nRemember, it's essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to develop a personalized treatment plan that suits your needs. They can help you manage your diabetes and prevent any complications.\\n\\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 228, 'prompt_tokens': 392, 'total_tokens': 620, 'completion_time': 0.912, 'prompt_time': 0.107299447, 'queue_time': 1.477318526, 'total_time': 1.019299447}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-70b-versatile', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5c5d1b5cfb', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-e6928ae1-2bb3-498a-b1a9-5a367ae46ee9-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 392, 'output_tokens': 228, 'total_tokens': 620})\n",
